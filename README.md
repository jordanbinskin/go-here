## Go Here - The last travel app you will ever need (lol).

The title tagline is my attempt at being a copywriter, I think I'll stick with development.

This is a travel application born amidst feelings of wanderlust during this self-isolation period a large majority of the world are experiencing right now.

The purpose of the app is to allow you to put together a high level itinerary of a trip by destination - giving you useful information such as a travel time between each location, giving you an idea of time needed to pull off the itinerary.

It utilises
* React for UI
* Node for static hosting and build.
* Google Maps/Places API.
* Redux for managing app state
